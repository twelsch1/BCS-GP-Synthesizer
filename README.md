# BCS-GP-Synthesizer
This is an implementation of the BCS framework, reliant on the [Binary Classification Synthesis library](https://github.com/twelsch1/Binary-Classification-Synthesis), 
that achieves Program Synthesis using an implementation of Genetic
Programming that is built on the [ECJ library](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/). A more detailed description of this
implementation will be added to this README in the near future.
